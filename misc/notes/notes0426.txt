Swap's advice

Datastructure 
use dataframe array or lists?

Interesting graph algorithms
-> strongly connected components (clusters of communities)

Graph theory and social networks
graph partitioning algorithm
six degrees of separation

Variance
Fourier transform
Cosine similarity between movies

Networks crowds and markets (textbook) + CLRS
graph partitioning 
application to real world
neighborhood overlap
clustering coefficient

Training on multiple images for a single person: possible on face_recognition? How accurate?
TODO: test compare similar faces and check for false positives. If good enough, use. If more false negatives, use more encodings.
opencv read frames from video: faster to loop entire frame OR skip to nth frame?
